# facialrecognition
Our face recognition system, weâ€™ve first perform face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.
We used two libraries function
1. dilb function
2. face_recogniton function
